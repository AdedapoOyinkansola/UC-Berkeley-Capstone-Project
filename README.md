### Project Title
Supervised Machine Learning Model to Predict Pass or Fail in Critical Areas of Semiconductor Manufacturing Process

**Author**
Adedapo Oyeyemi

#### Executive summary
The purpose of this project is specifically to develop supervised classification algorithms that are robust enough to handle massive amounts of dataset 
generated through semiconductor manufacturing processes and be able to use these massive datasets as input to these developed algorithms for the efficient
prediction of failure at critical stages of semiconductor manufacturing process.
 
#### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question?
Due to the latest chip shortage being experienced particularly by auto-manufacturers across the USA and the world at large, it has become increasingly 
important to increase supply of high quality semiconductor chips to the market. 

#### Research Question
What are you trying to answer?
Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm(s) that can efficiently predict cases of failure during the testing phase in the critical areas of 
semiconductor manufacturing.

#### Data Sources
What data will you use to answer you question?
Semi-conductor data

#### Methodology
What methods are you using to answer the question?
Developed Supervised Classification Algorithms:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine
XGBoost Classifier
Decision Tree Classifier
Neural Network
Naive Bayes

#### Results
What did your research find?
The algorithms with the best performance that will efficiently predict failure cases are
Random Forest Classifier
XGBoost Classifier
Decision Tree Classifier

F1 Score was used to select the best performing models. This is because of the imbalanced dataset.
